Front End  and BackEnd ko connect karne ka kaam karti hai API 

earlier it was AJAX: Async Javascript And XML but that was earlier now its

Async Javascript And JSON in the form of Fetch and Axios(its a third party package)
fetch and axios is the practicle implementation of AJAX 

API IS LINK WITH WHICH I CAN SEND AND RECEIVE DATA TO AND FROM BACKEND 

FRONTEND : HAMESHA REQUET KARTA HAI 
BACKEND : HAMESHA RESPONSE KARTA HAI 

DATA IS REQUESTED with the help of Api 

THE CONCEPT IS : AJAX 
we implement it with the help of Fetch or Json 
AXIOS IS BETTER 
Fetch returns string : usko fir json mai convert karna padhta hai 
but Axios gives json directly so we need not to change it to json 

Axios ka humme ek hii object chahiye aur firr usse alag alag components
mai use krr dena chahiye 

axios ka ek hii object banaye aur usse jahah use karna chahte hai waha use karre 

Agar ek ki jagah 50-60 component hote 
toh axios ko configure karna padhta
