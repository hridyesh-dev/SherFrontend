Front End  and BackEnd ko connect karne ka kaam karti hai API 

earlier it was AJAX: Async Javascript And XML but that was earlier now its

Async Javascript And JSON in the form of Fetch and Axios(its a third party package)
fetch and axios is the practicle implementation of AJAX 

API IS LINK WITH WHICH I CAN SEND AND RECEIVE DATA TO AND FROM BACKEND 

FRONTEND : HAMESHA REQUET KARTA HAI 
BACKEND : HAMESHA RESPONSE KARTA HAI 

DATA IS REQUESTED with the help of Api 

THE CONCEPT IS : AJAX 
we implement it with the help of Fetch or Json 
AXIOS IS BETTER 
Fetch returns string : usko fir json mai convert karna padhta hai 
but Axios gives json directly so we need not to change it to json 

Axios ka humme ek hii object chahiye aur firr usse alag alag components
mai use krr dena chahiye 

axios ka ek hii object banaye aur usse jahah use karna chahte hai waha use karre 

Agar ek ki jagah 50-60 component hote 
toh axios ko configure krr luga and fir usse outsource krr luga  jiss se mai usse alag alag tarike se use krr luga

AN INTRO TO USE EFFECT HOOK 

now we need to click on a product to get products what we we want it that way 
where jaise hii mai open karu ap the data should be here automatically 

for this i will use useEffect() hook 

COMPONENT LIFECYCLE IN REACT : 
3 STATES IN REACT 
1) MOUNT : 
jab component view mai show hota hai : Munting / Create 

2) UNMOUNT:
jab component view se hatt jaata hai : Unmount / remove 

3)UPDATE:
aur jab state change hota hai toh Update hota hai 
kisi component mai change aana 


component pehle mount hota hai -------> Then update hota hai --------> then Unmount hota hai 
it is three parts of component lifecycle 

to implement this we use useEffect hook 
IT IS ALSO KNOWN AS LIFE CYCLE HOOK 

API CALLING KE KAAM AATA HAI :

example : component bann ne pe products aa jaaye 
comonent delete hone pe products hatt jaaye 

jab component create hota hai , ya component update hota hai 
ya jab component destroy hota hai vaise time pe useEffect() apne aap CALL hota hai
