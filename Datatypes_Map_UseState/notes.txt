how different data types are rendered in our view 
use State 
and then Two Way Binding 

we cant see boolean, used for comparison , 
condition but cant be seen in view 

we also cant see null and undefined values 
kyuki yeh sab are reserved keywords 

Array ki voh values dikhe gi which are non null , 
undefined or boolean only strings and numbers will 
be shown and that too in concatinated format 

how we can see Json data , Array of objects 
with the help of map

DB mai array of objects ki form mai data save krr diya 
to show this we can make use for Map 

difference between ForEach and Map 
for each : kuch naya return nahi hota 
map : map ek new array return karega 

const data = array.map((single,index)=>{
    return (
        //some data 
    )
})
