// starting react 
HTML,CSS,JS : Mai reloading ki dikkat hai , in case of submitting form and ancor tags
voh refresh ho rahi thi , reload ho rahi thi this was not efficient to deal with it , react came  into being 

React , Angular , Vue is used to make SPA : single page application : website pe koi bhi kaam karo , no reloading 
firr it wont be reloading, react is a LIBRARY created by facebook ut Angular is framework made my Google

earlier sites were MPA: multiple page application

LIBRARY vs FRAMEWORK
if we move to a new apartment , we got minimal required stuff like 4 walls and a roof , that is our library , we will get bare minimum stuff that we need to work with
but if we moved to a pg we get everything we needed , tv, fridge etc ... : thats FRAMEWORK , FRAMEWORK provides us the whole ecosystem 

library will give us a minimal boiler plate which will make it flexible and easy to work with  
framework will give us everything  we need to make an application

REACT  : it is a LIBRARY created by meta , it gives us flexible boilderplate to work with 
jo install karna hai voh humm khud krr lenge 

Angular : it is a framework created by Google , while angular is only the frontend framework 

NEXT JS : it is the fullstack framework of react , to capture the framework market 

What makes React Great ?
browser waali website ko DOM Bolte hai , 
yeh jo bhi website hai react ne  iski copy bana leta hai isse kehte hai virtual dom 

abbt there are some changes and 
then it'll compair the two and then apply the changes sirf unhi jaah update karega , na page ko reload karega , na application ko reload charega 
this process of finding changes  diffing algorithm and this is called as recocillation

react ki voh ability jiske wajah se hamari website puri reload nahi hoti sirf jo changes kiye 
hai voh update ho jaaye ge 

jaha changes kiye hai , jo changes kiye hai sirf vohi apply honge 

we need Node to run react on our system 

why do we need node ? 

NPM : Node Package Manager : 
it is used to download and use various packages whose functionality we need in our project 
iss npm ko use karne ke liye we need NODE , bina node ke humm npm se packages nahi use/download nahi  krr sakte

HOW TO SET UP YOUR REACT PROJECT : 
npm 

vite : it is the tool jiski help se humm boiler plate setup krr sakte hai 
like humm amazon ke through shoes mangwa rahe hai 

USE THIS COMMAND TO SET UP THE FOLDER STRUCTURE : 
npm create vite@latest

Jsx : combination of Js and HTML
