// starting react 
HTML,CSS,JS : Mai reloading ki dikkat hai , in case of submitting form and ancor tags
voh refresh ho rahi thi , reload ho rahi thi this was not efficient to deal with it , react came  into being 

React , Angular , Vue is used to make SPA : single page application : website pe koi bhi kaam karo , no reloading 
firr it wont be reloading, react is a LIBRARY created by facebook ut Angular is framework made my Google

earlier sites were MPA: multiple page application

LIBRARY vs FRAMEWORK
if we move to a new apartment , we got minimal required stuff like 4 walls and a roof , that is our library , we will get bare minimum stuff that we need to work with
but if we moved to a pg we get everything we needed , tv, fridge etc ... : thats FRAMEWORK , FRAMEWORK provides us the whole ecosystem 

library will give us a minimal boiler plate which will make it flexible and easy to work with  
framework will give us everything  we need to make an application

NEXT JS : it is framework of react
