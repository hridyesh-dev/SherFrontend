What is context API 
earlier we needed to put data into common parent : and 
passed it with the help of prop drilling  but because of that 

we unecessarily passed data from one component to other just because they 
can pass the data further 


to solve this problem context api came into being 
when were sending data directly with the help of context api 
 
context will wrap whole our app and then we can get it from anywhere 
prop ki jaah context ka use karo 

ek alag se component banao aur yaha data store karo aur waha se  export krr lo 
jaha use karna hai waha usse import krr do 
this is done with the help of context 

context api is used on the bases of higher order components 

Higher Order Function : ek aisa Function that will take another 
function as its argument or return a function is called Higher Order Function 

Higher Order Component : ek aisa component that will take another component in its props 
and return a component is called a HIGHER ORDER Component , it acts like a wrapper 

components will either take component as a prop  or return another component 
it will work as a wrapper
