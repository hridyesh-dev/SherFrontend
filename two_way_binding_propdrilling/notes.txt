//agar humne user interactive banana hai ki user data daal paaye aur humm receive krr paaye
AISA KUCH BANE KAISE : TWO WAY BINDING 
YEH HOTI KAISI HAI : MAI CHAHTA HU KI MAI DATA ENTER KARU AUR VOH LIST MAI SHOW HO JAAYE 

//page refresh nahi hona chahiye : THIS is the default nature of input 
TWO WAY BINDING IS JUST FOR FORM ELEMENTS 
FORM field ------>react(useState or anything )------>back to form field

it will create a controlled element : ki react ko pata hai humm kyaa likh rahe hai 

TO SAVE IN REACT :  we will use onChange on input field ------------------------
react mai jo save hai usse input mai lagane ke liye : lagaye ge Value -------------->these are input variables 

onChange se react mai save karo, value ki help se react se laake inpput field mai laao

 Components breaking and prop drilling 

PROPS HELP US TO MAINTAIN READABILITY OF OUR CODE BY 
BREAKING IT INTO REUSABLE COMPONENTS 

APP.js: blank , configuration file rakho (routing , auth)
COMPONENTS IS BROKEN ON THE BASES OF FUNCTIONALITY 
ek component ko ek functionality se break karna chahiye 

here : there are 2 functionalities 
1) user ko register karna 
2) user ka data dikhana 


DATA KA FLOW BETWEEN COMPONENTS IS DONE WITH THE HELP OF PROPS

COMPONENTS ka naam Capital letter mai likho

Aisa data jo dono jagah use ho raha hai , we will use props here 
between app and create/read there is parent chil relationship and 
data is sent from parent to child through props 
aise data jo same data share karte hai unka data is stored in their common parent 
and send with the help of props drilling , it is unidirectional from parent to child 
and cant go the other way

DATA IS PASSED THROUGH ATTRIBUTES
